Hummingbot Dashboard is a community project to build dashboards that help you deploy, manage, backtest, and analyze Hummingbot instances (and much more!) Each dashboard is maintained by 1-2 community members.

### Dashboards

Here are the current dashboards in the collection:

* 🐙 **Bot Orchestration**: Deploy and manage Hummingbot instances

* 🗂 **Candles Downloader**: Download historical exchange data as OHLVC candles. Supports multiple trading pairs and custom time ranges/intervals.
* 🔍 **DB Inspector**: Inspect and analyze the orders and trades data contained in a Hummingbot strategy database
* 🧙 **Token Spreads**: Identify cross-exchange trading opportunities by analyzing differences in token spreads across venues
